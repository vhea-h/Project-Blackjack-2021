    My process for giving advice depends on the dealer's upcard, and the player's hand. Since the advice 
    function doesn't cheat, a player still may lose following the advice due to bad luck. Inspiration for these
    suggestions came from the Bicycle website. 
    --Advice system:--
    If the dealer's upcard is 7, 8, 9, 10, or ace, player will be prompted to keep hitting until they 
    reach at least 17.
    If the dealer's upcard is 4, 5, or 6, player will be prompted to keep hitting until they 
    reach at least 12.
    If the dealer's upcard is 2 or 3, player will be prompted to keep hitting until they 
    reach at least 13.
